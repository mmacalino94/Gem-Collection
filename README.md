# Crystal Collection Game Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, we were tasked to create a point and clickesque game using jQuery, HTML and CSS. 

The goal is to match your score with a random number displayed at the start of the game. To reach that number the player must click on the four items shown. In this one I used currency items used in video games.

* Sonic Rings
* Crash Bandicoot's Wumpa Fruit
* Mario Coins
* The Legend of Zelda Rupee's

When one of the 4 is clicked, a specified amount of points will be added to the player's total score. These points are randomly set for each currency item and will not be shown to the player until it is added to the total score. 

So yes, math is involved. Oh, and these points will randomly change in each round. The game would be boring otherwise. ;)


### To Win

The player will win the round if the total score matches the random number displayed in each round.

If the player's total score is more than the random number then the player loses the round.

A scoreboard will tally how many wins and losses the player makes.

Once the player wins or loses, the game restarts and a new random number will be displayed.
